        <p>Dear Elly,</p>
        <p>You are a journalism major, you express things with pen and paper.  I am an Information Science major, so I am expressing
        things in the way I know best - through a website - I know its super cliche - but its me, what do you expect? :) I know its
        been said time and time again, but I just want this to remind you how much you mean to me and how grateful and thankful I
        am for the effort you put into me and us.  Most ordinary girls would not put up with how we go about our lives. But you are
        far from ordinary, and I am so thankful every waking moment to have found a person that I bond with so well and that is
        willing to put so much effort into something plays such an important role in my life. I honestly dont know what I would
        do without you in my life, and I cant imagine it any other way. I know that sometimes it is sad to be so far apart, I get
        sad about it too, but when we are together, it is like the whole world stops and everything becomes perfect, school doesnt
        exist, stress isnt a thing, and time moves much more slowly. I think that suffering through a little bit of sadness is
        completely worth all of the incredible experiences that we have had, and are going to have moving forward.  In order to
        remind you of some of those experiences, I have included a nifty little slideshow below to encapsulate some of my favorite
        moments, though there are many more moments that live in my memory and not in pictures.</p>

    <div class="div2">
    <p>I hope that you never forget how special you are to me, and that I am willing to do whatever it takes to keep this amazing thing we have alive.
    You are such a catch, and I feel so lucky to be the nerdy guy that you chose to be your partner in crime. Please do not ever stop being the genuine,
    caring, fun-loving, and beautiful person that I have come to know and love.</p>
    <p>You will forever be in my heart.</p>
    <p>Love always, <br> Chris</p>
